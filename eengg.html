                  Introduction
               </h4>

               <p>
                  Department of Electrical Engineering was established in 2008
                  in order to meet the short and long term requirements of
                  industrial/ commercial organizations of Pakistan for graduates
                  in Electrical Engineering. Subsequent to the decision of the
                  Board of Governors for starting the discipline of Electrical
                  Engineering, University improved its infrastructure in
                  accordance with the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC)
                  guidelines and developed purpose built Classrooms,
                  Laboratories and allied facilities. Electrical Engineering is
                  one of the oldest fields of engineering. Initially, Electrical
                  Engineering was confined to Power Generation, Transmission
                  lines distribution and Telephony. However, due to advancement
                  and rapid growth in technology, there is tremendous expansion
                  in various areas of Electrical Engineering. This expansion is
                  so large that each area is now recognized as independent
                  discipline. These include Telecommunication Engineering,
                  Electronic Engineering, Power Engineering, Computer
                  Engineering, Control System Engineering and many more.
                  However, Electrical Engineering is still considered as parent
                  discipline to these areas. The department has to an up-to-date
                  library, stocked with the latest reading materials and
                  text-books for the use of the students and the faculty
                  members.The department arranges seminars and workshops on
                  various areas of Electrical Engineering. These seminars are
                  delivered by faculty members and prominent scholars. Before
                  the commencement of the program, Pakistan Engineering Council
                  inspected the University's facilities under its Zero Visit's
                  and gave prior permission to start degree program in
                  Electrical Engineering. PEC through its visits accredited the
                  following batches of the University i.e. 2008, 2009, 2010,
                  2011, 2012 & 2013 so far.
               </p>
