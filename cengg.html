                        I take the privilege to welcome you all to the Civil
                        Engineering Department of CUSIT. Considering the
                        importance of Civil and Environmental Engineering to the
                        well-being of humans in the world in general and to
                        Pakistan in particular, I feel honored and indebt at the
                        same time to lead such an important department. I
                        believe that the knowledge and expertise gained in such
                        diverse fields of civil and environmental engineering as
                        Water resources engineering, Structure engineering,
                        Transportation and Geotechnical engineering etc., one is
                        exposed to wealth of knowledge that is unequal in any
                        other under-graduate program. This uniqueness does
                        burden one with respect to doing justice with such
                        responsibility. Thankfully, at CUSIT the support of
                        motivated and qualified academic and administrative
                        staff makes this burden easier to carry. As accredited
                        program of Pakistan Engineering Council, CED has fully
                        evolved it self to Output Based Education System, at the
                        core of which is studentï¿½s excellence in all fields of
                        civil and environmental engineering. Our courses are
                        developed based on the provincial and national needs of
                        the industry, with the help of renowned academicians and
                        industrialists. The facilities at the department ensures
                        that the tailor-made courses are effectively taught. The
                        high percentage of our graduating students occupying
                        important job postings rather quickly, is testament to
                        our excellence. We hope that with each passing day, we
                        are able to improve further our department and that we
                        are able to bring change in our society through
                        market/industry-based research and studies.
